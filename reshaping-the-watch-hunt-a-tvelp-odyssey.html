          Aakash, an avid watch enthusiast, dreamt of adorning his wrist with a
          stunning Fossil watch. However, in India, the Fossil watch was priced
          nearly triple its US cost due to unjustified price gouging. Unwilling
          to be swayed by unfair practices, Aakash sought alternatives and
          discovered Tvelp, a platform promising fair access to global goods
          through the collaboration of international travelers.
